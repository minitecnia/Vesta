# OShw-Milcan (Open source hardware milcan platform)

Openhw-milcan includes developed software and hardware using COTS for CAN utils purposes.This project has two platforms, the first is an open platform for getting CAN messages, GPS and IMU signals, the second platform includes an open platform for getting and registering CAN messages and IMU signals.

# Ardu-can
This project is a USB sensor gateway for registering CAN data, GPS and IMU signals. This uses an Arduino platform as a gateway. Data registering is activated while USB interface is connected, using a software broker in a linux platform.
# arducan-reader
Software broker implemented in python.

# Raspi-can

# TTEthernet over Raspberry
Yo can enable True Time Ethernet with Ethercat in <a href=https://github.com/thanhtam-h/soem-w5500-rpi>EtherCAT with w5500</a>
